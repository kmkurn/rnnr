        checkpoint_key: Get the checkpoint from ``state[checkpoint_key]``. A checkpoint
            is a mapping whose keys are filenames and the values are the objects to checkpoint.
            The filenames in this dictionary's keys are prepended with the number of times
            this handler is called to get the actual saved files' names. This allows the
            actual filenames contain the e.g. epoch number if this handler is invoked at the
            end of each epoch.
        max_saved: Maximum number of checkpoints saved.
        loss_key: Get the loss value from ``state[loss_key]``. Checkpoints are saved only
            when the loss is smaller than the minimum loss observed so far. The default
            of ``None`` means checkpoints are saved whenever this handler is called.
        save_fn: Function to invoke to save the checkpoints. If given, this must be a callable
            accepting two arguments: an object to save and a path to save it to. The default
            is to save the object using `pickle`.
